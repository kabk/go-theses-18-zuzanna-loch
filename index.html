			<div class="front"><h2>I’m interested in the topic of cultural representation and understanding of&nbsp;sex.</h2></div>

			<h1>I’m interested in the culture-rooted perspectives and reasons for which they shaped the way we perceive&nbsp;sex. <br><br>
			Sexuality never stops being controversial. Some aspects are overly exposed in media and culture, while others keep being taboo'ed, connected with guilt, embarassment and shaming.I wonder where these emotions come from and whether they are culture or nature based. My hypothesis is that the way the sex is being approached is a cultural outcome of different political, religious, cultural influences from the&nbsp;history.<br><br>
			Sex is part of our very intimate personal nature and psychology, yet we reach for ready made answers from culture to help us understand it and shape it to meet certain model, while the picture we get from culture is quite distorted. Or maybe it is completely right? I wonder what it does say about us as Western&nbsp;society.<br><br>I would like to explore how the phenomenon of sex is approached in different cultures and what effort is being made to manipulate the image of it. Further on I want to speculate on how it COULD be presented if we imagined dismissing the culturaly rooted tropes. I’m planning to read and watch academic materials about sexuality and gender psychology to understand the topic a bit and analyse the visual quality and representation in media and eventually come up with alternative&nbsp;scenarios.<h1>

			<div class="introduction"><h3>The work starts with the word "sex" in its title. The three letters provoke a certain rush of blood to the head. From there on, at the imaginary readers' table we can observe a range of diverse reactions - some positive, others annoyed, unfavourable. For some, mentioning the three letter word wakes up a nerver of inner anxiety. The audience lets itself to consider the author as a sexual being. The variety of reactions depends on the number of factors (e.g. age, origin, gender, religion, personality, sexual satisfaction levels, traumas, education, way of upringing etc.). A similar phenomenon occurs when the three letter combination appears in a set, surrounded by other letters, unintentionally (e.g. Middlesex, sexennial, sexton, sextuple, sextette etc.). For some reason 'sex' has a larger responsive imact than other words that have also appeared in the foregoing text, like 'table', or 'blood'. The intention of this thesis isn't to say that it's a bad&nbsp;thing.</h3></div>
