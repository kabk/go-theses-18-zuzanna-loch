				<h2>I’m interested in the topic of cultural representation and understanding of&nbsp;sex.<br><br><br><br></h2>
			

			<h1>I’m interested in the culture-rooted perspectives and reasons for which they shaped the way we perceive&nbsp;sex. <br><br>
			Sexuality never stops being controversial. Some aspects are overly exposed in media and culture, while others keep being taboo'ed, connected with guilt, embarassment and shaming.I wonder where these emotions come from and whether they are culture or nature based. My hypothesis is that the way the sex is being approached is a cultural outcome of different political, religious, cultural influences from the&nbsp;history.<br><br>
			Sex is part of our very intimate personal nature and psychology, yet we reach for ready made answers from culture to help us understand it and shape it to meet certain model, while the picture we get from culture is quite distorted. Or maybe it is completely right? I wonder what it does say about us as Western&nbsp;society.<br><br>I would like to explore how the phenomenon of sex is approached in different cultures and what effort is being made to manipulate the image of it. Further on I want to speculate on how it COULD be presented if we imagined dismissing the culturaly rooted tropes. I’m planning to read and watch academic materials about sexuality and gender psychology to understand the topic a bit and analyse the visual quality and representation in media and eventually come up with alternative&nbsp;scenarios.<h1>

			<div class="introduction">
				<h3>The work starts with the word "sex" in its title. The three letters provoke a certain rush of blood to the head. From there on, at the imaginary readers' table we can observe a range of diverse reactions - some positive, others annoyed, unfavourable. For some, mentioning the three letter word wakes up a nerver of inner anxiety. The audience lets itself to consider the author as a sexual being. The variety of reactions depends on the number of factors (e.g. age, origin, gender, religion, personality, sexual satisfaction levels, traumas, education, way of upringing etc.). A&nbsp;similar phenomenon occurs when the three letter combination appears in a set, surrounded by other letters, unintentionally (e.g. Middlesex, sexennial, sexton, sextuple, sextette etc.). For some reason 'sex' has a larger responsive impact than other words that have also appeared in the foregoing text, like 'table', or 'blood'. The intention of this thesis isn't to say that it's a bad&nbsp;thing.<br><br></h3>

				<h2>What is the intention of this thesis?</h2>

				<h3>Well, let me tell you about the Trobriant islanders from North-Western Melanesia. <br><br>
			
			
				<div class="multiply">
					<img src="images/trobriant.jpg">
				</div>
			
				Trobriant islands belong to Papua New Guinea and have been inhabited by indigenous people. In Trobriant society it is a taboo to eat in front of other people. The islanders consume their meals alone, shunning from the eye of others. But the activity they are more comfortable about is sex. Both male and female inhabitants are free to have as much sexual intercourse and partners as they want before and during being&nbsp;married.<br><br>

				There is no festive wedding ceremony. A couple of lovers stay for the night together. If the girl doesn't come home before the sunrise, the mother brings cooked yams to the lovers in the morning. The couple eats next to each other. At this point the marriage is established. From there on, they eat together for one year, after which they go back to eating&nbsp;separately.<br><br>

				Reading the research of Bronisław Malinowski from 1929 brings up a feeling that in perception of Trobriants, eating has a similar emotional implications/connotations as for us does sex and vice versa. For the islanders, eating is a private, intimate element of life, only shared with a spouse. Sex on the other hand is a common activity, not held under a certain taboo, shame social disgrace, not limited to monogamy&nbsp;etc.<br><br>

				<div class="multiply">
					<img src="images/trobriant3.jpg">
				</div>

				I find it truly fascinating how sex for them is just a 'thing'. What is it that made sex so problematic then in our world? Sociology and sexuology give the answer that is not truly our nature to be so problematic and oppressive on the topic of sex, it is rather the history and culture that through centuries have shaped our traumas, discomforts and fears, regulations, gender norms, denials of different orientations, morals, guilt which we started assigning to particular parts of our&nbsp;bodies.<br><br>

				The intention of this thesis is to wonder. Why and how did we get to the point where we understand and represent sex the way we do? Could it have gone another way? Why do we search for answers to the understanding of our bodies from/in the culture? What does the culture think about sex? Does the culture like&nbsp;it?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="fiction">
				In order to answer these questions we shall go back to 1757's household of merchant Antoine Orlando in Paris, where his long awaited child is being born. The great joy doesn't last long, since it quickly turns out that the child's gender is hard to determine. The baby holds both types of genitals. Terrified parents decide to establish the newborn's identity as male and give him the name Alexandre. They never spread the problematic information&nbsp;further.<br><br>

				Four decades later, Alexandre Orlando becomes one of the most influential people in France. After quadrupling family's fortune, hir gets acknowledged at the royal house of Bourbon as a friend and adviseur. It has been speculated that Orlando's intersex gender was known among the elites and that hir has been involved in a romantic relationship with the latest king before the French Revolution, Louis XVI. The monarch is beheaded in 1793 and the Revolution develops. Orlando manages to avoid consequences of belonging to the royal circles and joins the revolutionist, attempting a sabotage in which hir would avenge the king. After some time spent among the revolutionists, hir starts being convinced about their ideas and the plan of revenge is dismissed. Alexandre Orlando becomes a leader of the French Revolution and hir gender is revealed. Alexandre's skills in economy and strategy seemed to be more important than the feminine part of hir's identity, so the society decides to accept hirs&nbsp;dissimilarity. <br><br>

				Orlando turns hirs devotion for the revolt towards hirs own revolution of gender. Hir strongly condemns the abolishing of all of the Revolution's women's clubs by Jacobin, who was the most influential political club of the period. The crushing of the women's movement took place in October 1793 and resulted in arresting of the female clubs' leaders. In 1795 Orlando applies for re-establishment of those and partly succeeds. From around 30 female clubs, the existence of which has been recorded before Jacobin's invasion, 7 reborn thanks to Orlando. Hir himself has been maintaining a status of not belonging to any of the clubs. In this way, hir was allowed to take part in meetings of many, staying transparent and confronting ideas of those, raising debates and aiming on focusing on common goals. Orlando's incredible dyplomatic skills and financial genious provided hir with respect of the most prominent clubs, which seems even more exceptional if we consider the fact that hir was commonly known for mingling with Bourbons before the Revolution. In 1796 hir comes out officially and requires to be referred to as Hermaphrodite Orlando. The revolution in the approach to gender is progressing, as Hermaphrodite acquires powerful position and proposes the new French church to consider making space in its structures for people like hir. The Church is firstly negative, but later decides to make a pact with Orlando in order to improve their poor situation after being separated from the&nbsp;state. <br><br>

				In 1801 the Humano Sexualis decrete is being signed by both parties, where the Church promises to break down gender-based limitations on all levels. This is a groundbreaking event in the history of sexuality. The new open face of the French Catholic Church bridges the divisions, confusion, pain and bitterness of the previous decade. 90 years later, first woman, Elisabeth Williams becomes a pope and she takes the name of Catherine the&nbsp;I.<br><br>


				How did the lifting of patriarchal gender limitations for ordaining for priesthood influence the deeply male-dominant social structures of XIX century' France? Or in other words - what did society say about a non-male priest? The fact that not only males were allowed to ecclesiastical structures anymore, mainly meant introducing women to church, since intersex people like Orlando were in a great minority, ofter (if not always) living in a&nbsp;closet. <br><br>

				The first few decades were turbulent. The French Church suffered significant decline after the Revolution and even though the new open-minded and modern policy attracted some parts of the society, it sickened the others. There have been repetitive cases of churches being set on fire all over the country in churches that consisted of not exclusively male priests. A lot of public debate took place whether women are able to learn the art of the higher state of serving God than nunhood, whther their spiritual priestly vocation is possible. A lot of politicians, folks and priests argued that the Humano Sexualis is a profanation of the Constitution of Christ who ordinated only men for his apostles. The response of the French Church was that like in early Christianity, women should be allowed to serve as deacons, priests and bishops, and that there isn't any biblical reason to prohibit women's&nbsp;ordination. <br><br>

				<div class="quote">
					"Humankind was created as God's reflection: in the divine image God created them, female and male, God made them." - Genesis&nbsp;1:27<br><br>

					"In Christ there is no Jew or Greek, slave or citizen, male or female. All are one in Christ Jesus." - Galatians&nbsp;3:28
				</div><br><br>

				The approach of the French Church was highly opposite both to the European standards and the earlier standpoints of the church itself. Before Humano Sexualis, the highest role a female catholic could serve was nun. Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France, neither were their voices or meaning acknowledged by the Church. Only after Revolution took its toll on the Catholic Church by confiscating its property, eliminating privileges as well as massive executions on priests during the Reign of Terror, the approach shifted. After years of brutal oppression, the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and pope Pius VII is signed, restoring the Catholic Church in France. The fast response of Orlando to the event helps defining the new face of that Church in the still rough times. It has been commonly argued that the gender direction change in the French Church wouldn't have ever happened without Orlando's suggestion and non-males might not be authorised priesthood in churches worldwide for centuries to&nbsp;come. <br><br>

				<img src="images/book.jpg">
				Humano Sexualis influenced the global approach to gender, although women kept being seen as the second category humans, always establishing inferior positions in parishes. Despite the decree, until XX century the majority of French churches didn't give positions for women to hold, which is a texbook example of how strong the male supremacy was at the time. Not only the superiors didn't put trust in women though. Apart from extreme cases like church building arsons and female priest killings, the parishioners were demonstrating less regard to them compared to the inviolable male priest's persona. Bishop Eloise Deschamps elaborates on this topic in her book "Deliberations on a Female&nbsp;Servant".<br><br>

				<div class="quote">
					"Priestesses of the French Catholic Church after Humano Sexualis were exposed to a very questionable respect and general mistreatment. For the exceptional ones that managed to hold position it was common to be located in the rectorial basements, often together with nuns. They rarely were given opportunity to provide  confessions as well as participate in Eucharistic procedures. Their role was rather vague, somewhere between a nun and Deaconess, depending on the parishes individual policy. The regulations considering non-male priests didn't exist. Hence formally they all were liable to the same laws. Nevertheless it took a century for the female priests to pave their way to the higher ministry corresponding to their spiritual vocation. These yet were the fruits of the hardship of the revolutionary times of our Holy commonwealth. The wisdom of the Lord resides in the challenges he puts on us. Last decades are the proof of the great achievements built on devotion and strength of the individuals. We have always been, are and will be vulnerable to the culturally based habits, prejudices supported by years and years of practice. The question is how to apply the learning of Jesus Christ to our contemporaneity? How to find the truest value of tradition and separate it from teh relics of our sore history? How to sort the wheat from the chaff? Our duty is to seek for the divine form of our reverence of God. This process takes place since the beginning of Christianity and shall continue as we, believers should always take effort to improve our ministry with a great commitment. My predecessors from the dawn of XIX century were never acknowledged with a bow by the folk. They couldn't baptise nor bury. They devoted themselves to the hardship of the service, knowing that they are likely to be killed by those who were blinded by false values. yet they persisted, as we should all persist with our&nbsp;faith."<br><br>
				</div>

				Admittance of non-male priest to the French Church lead to the situation we are living now, where no longer does gender define believers' role or&nbsp;potential. <br><br>

				Yet how did it correspond to the transformations in the secular&nbsp;understanding?<br><br>

				Despite the fact that French Revolution caused decline of Catholic power and almost disappearance of the Church, religion was the main root of sociologic standards in various areas. This phenomenon hasn't changed even after French de-Christianisation, therefore when Humano Sexualis was introduced, there appeared a chance for consideration about patriarchy and the role of women in the&nbsp;society.<br><br>

				The claims of first wave feminist movements received more attention, not only in France. Humano Sexualis has encourged women to be persistent with their statements and has often been used as an argument for letting women also in the other institutional structures and education. More voices have been raising to argue whether women are really inferior to men and what is it that decides upon limiting their potential and opportunities. In countries like United Kingdom, Netherlands, Sweden and United States feminist issues and gender roles were being written about in media and literature, and slowly the laws started to be passed on the topics like economic separation from husbands, owning and managing properties, being employed in schools as teachers. In 1833, Ohio opened the first co-educational&nbsp;university.<br><br>

				Firstly the opportunities on the formal level of economy, politics, management and education, and later the time has come to address the sociological issues, like reproduction and sex, cultural position of women in the&nbsp;society.<br><br> 

				Here we come to the point where the heavily oppressed and tabooed topic of sex starts appearing in popular news media and becomesgenerally acknowledged as an issue that requires attention. It wouldn't be possible to start the research on the development of sexuality and transformation of the understanding of sex without talking about the great achievements of feminists and Orlando, as they were the ones to start turning the wheel in both areas: perception of sexuality and gender&nbsp;equality.<br><br>

				It is not needed to explain how strict were the social codes concerning sex in those times. Even though human nature was always finding its ways when it comes to premarital sex, homosexuality, bisexuality, polyamory etc., it was never being openly confronted. Heterosexual, monogamous marriage followed by appearance of offspring was a condition of decency and fulfilling the expectations of the social status quo. Nevertheless people were staying in multiple relationships, having affairs, lovers, spreading illnesses and satisfying their need for not-heterosexual love - everything as long as it wasn't revealed to the eye of the public, as long as the family, neighbours and children didn't&nbsp;see.<br><br>

				The abolition of gender limits in churches has spread to other countries, once Pope Leo XV filed such right in and reconnected with the French Catholic Church, admitting the righteousness of Humano Sexualis. Hermaphrodite Orlando died in 1809 aged 52. Although it has been always questioned whether someone who was so close to Bourbons once, should hold priviledges in the post-revolutionary France, Napoleon held Orlando in high esteem throughout the whole time. It has been even proved that they were exchanging letters, discussing the economic issues of France. After Orlando's death, intersexuality has been officially introduced to France as an alternative gender, and has been studies in Medical Studies. Soon, the French knowledge and heritage of Orlando opened the minds of British and German scholars and started being&nbsp;adapted. <br><br>

				Meanwhile pope Leo XV, took over after Pius VII, who dies in 1812 from the flu after being held in poor conditions in Savonne by Napoleon. Leo XV introduced more liberal projects, decriminalising divorce and listening to the female voice in the church. He appointed the first female bishop in 1820. Her name was Catherine and she was a British priestess from&nbsp;Manchester. <br><br>

				Since the introduction of women in the churches, more attention has been given to the topics of the family, social structures, respect and love of the other. That was happening along further achievements of feminists in Europe, but also worldwide. In 1823 in India, Sati, teh tradition of forced suicide of widows is banned. In Brasil in 1825 the first elementary schools for girls are opened. Women in general stopped being seen as belongings of men and due to that, the female independent identity was being gradually&nbsp;discovered.<br><br>

				Enlightenment made it possible for the human reason by the use of observation to investigate the laws of our nature, while not having to appeal to the doctrines of the Church or the eye of&nbsp;God. <br><br>

				At the same time, the Industrial Revolution contributed to the economic independence of women. Instead bearing the role of informal business partners in their husbands' shops, they started being acknowledged as workers who are as fit to work in factories as their husbands, sometimes even more then them. For both parties (women and the industry) that was a beneficial&nbsp;turn.<br><br>

				In 1852, Irish printers working for the historical Freeman's Journal started secretly and unofficially printing a humorous addition to their newspaper, without the knowledge of the journalists and writers. It was a one paragraph incorporated in the spread consisting of erotic writings and later small sized illustrations, either making fun of famous figures or providing articles and imagery of inappropriate and pornographic content. The Freeman's Special was a project brought by a group of approximately 20 anonymous creatives, writers and  artists, cooperating with the printing press workers. The addition was produced in small quantities and discretely distributed within the ones in the know. The costs of production were included in the expenses of the real Freeman's Journal, so that the press was unconsciously sponsored by the radically Protestant and nationalistic newspaper. However it was the matter of time before the world has discovered the indecent creation of the Irish boheme. On 20th March 1854, accidentally the printers sent to the shops the 'wrong' version of the Journal, among the hundreds of the official copies. The Freeman's Special was in the end just the Freeman's Journal with the content of one box replaced, so it wasn't  difficult for printers to make the mistake. Unwary customers read among the advertisements of furnished lodgings and open vacancies, a three sentence story on Sir Edward O'Brien's intimate fascination on Lord Mayor Edward Mc&nbsp;Donnel. <br><br>

				<div class="quote"><img src="images/freeman.png" width="300px">
					"Honourable Lord Edward Mc Donnel was thrown into a state of consternation on Friday afternoon, by a discovery that dear to his heart Sir Edward O'Brien invested in new French curtains to his mansion. No longer can Lord's eye be pleased by the sweet exploration of his platonic friend's nightgown's patterns through binoculars. "My eyeballs fancy the vision of disappearance of thy silks, yet not the appearance of these unsightly&nbsp;curtains!"

				</div>
				
				<br><br>

				Underneath the paragraph was a little icon depicting naked Sir O'Brien with erect penis. The release brought an incredible controversy, but also a significant increase in the Journal's demands. The chief editor of the Journal fired the entire printing group and sent for a replacement. Printshop workers lost their income and gained a bad reputation. In order to avenge the wrong, they committed to print the last edition of Journal consisting entirely of 'Special' content, and flee the country with their families in order to prevent enormous financial fines and possible jain sentences. they managed to distribute the obscene paper, but were afterwards caught by the police before leving the country. The packages of prints thrown carelessly into the streets of Dublin went like hot cakes, before police managed to seize them. Gossips on the sexual lives of Irish elites and unconventional sexual practice descriptions spread in the society, giving people piquant insight to the other faces of sex and making an impression as if in the higher classes homosexuality, bisexuality, orgy and other hedonistic sexual activities were completely common and&nbsp;accepted.<br><br>

				Even though the erotic literature was in great extent just fiction, the impact on the approach to sex was huge. The simple little illustrations of nudes and people making love in many different ways were most popular. The lucky owners of the special Freeman's Journal Special were cutting the paper in bits and confidentially selling them for prices that could equal to a monthly living costs. The interest in rare, yet known forms of lovemaking and the focus on pleasure were growing. In 1858, in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University establishes a course in human sex as a prat of curriculum in Biology, Medicine, Anatomy and Anthropology programmes. Five years later, the similar progress takes place in&nbsp;Sorbonne.<br><br>

				Studies over human nature bring revelations concerning sexuality and gender. United Kingdom declares the phenomenon of homosexuality as no longer a disease, but an alternative sexual orientation thanks to scientist Numa Numantius. Women are given voting rights in successive countries. Sexual Studies in 1860s start exploring the mysterious area of orgasmic pleasure. Masturbation, which for long time had been condemned as a sinful deed that could result in insanity and illness, has been proved by scientists not to be connected to any of the above mentioned and started being even prescribed in certain psychological conditions. The explanation of the human pleasure yet was a serious challenge to the scholars. Presence of female and intersexual students and professors at the leading European universities made it possible to explore different&nbsp;experiences.<br><br>

				For centuries before the sexual boom, in Christianity-dominated Western Europe, sexual pleasure used to be associated with evil, which should be avoided through the strict rules of procreative, heterosexual and post-marital  monogamy. Any form of research was hardly possible to conduct due to the heaviness of the taboo. Nevertheless there have been certain studies over the topic of sex and pleasure. One common aspect though that connects all of the writings from Hippocrates to Enlightenment is that they were always assuming 'male' to be the default unity, 'female' as the secondary supplement and other types of genders and sexualities were immensely ignored. The studies were being always conducted by male scholars and despite honest comprehensive efforts, the narrative over explanation of sex and attempt to define the sensation was in all of these sources highly limited to one kind of&nbsp;perception.<br><br>

				Only after the introduction of sexual studies and broadening the range of universities' participants, there became an opportunity to pick up the topic of sexual experience and make examination of other types of sex and sexuality, so far not properly studied. Alexis Tagaras's studies were comparing the impact of orgasm on bodies in different types of sex: hetero-, homosexual (both male and female), self-indulged through masturbation. The studies were revolutionary, as the notions of masturbation and homosexuality used to be still avoided. The outcomes have shown that in all cases, pleasurable satisfaction rates were higher in sex with partner rather than solitary masturbation and that females were experiencing wider variety of sensations and of stronger intensity, both in cases of homo and heterosexual intercourses. Further psychological investigation of Tagaras and his students who overtook the studies after hirs death in 1870 gave a proof for the beneficial implications of sexual satisfaction on mental health and well-being as well as physical health and immunity. In one word, the world has opened up to a thought that sex in deed isn't as evil as it used to be thought and there is no longer an argumentation for such conservative chains to hold people from pursuit of&nbsp;pleasure.<br><br>

				The decriminalisation of homosexuality resulted in huge interest of homosexuals in studies of sexuality, hence there was a significant shift in the societies of educational institutions from being heteronormative and male-dominated into becoming epicentres of liberated nature and intelectual discoveries motivated by sociological&nbsp;transitions.<br><br>

				Catholic church took an attitude of sharing the awareness of human weakness and sensitivity and was warning from the sin of harming. Pope Catherine I appealed to Christians that in the era of human liberation we need to keep away from causing harm to the other for the sake of our own needs. She argued that orgasmic pleasures are made by God to us, the people and that sharing such pleasure isn't sinful, as long as we treat our bodies with respect and care, being aware of the dangers of addictions, deviations and adultery. She was the one to legalise the homosexual marriage, staying firmly on the side of faithful monogamy, but not being particularly stern on premarital sex, although never officially admitting consent to it. She was also opposed to abolition of celibacy, even though in the end it happened during the reign of her succesor,&nbsp;pope Marcellus III.<br><br> 

				The fact that leading Western European universities started having wider variety of students when it comes to gender and sexual orientation had also an effect on how 'male' wasn't being seen as the default anymore. Biological and psychological studies started being propagated in the second half of XIX century, bringing revolutionary discoveries over women's psychology and differences conditioned by gender.  Studies proved that we all differ and instead of attempting to standardise power structures due to male preferences, we could use the potential of all humans in leading sustainable and democratic societies. In that period armies and governmental institutions started employing female members, after Queen Victoria made an appeal that the United Kingdom's future lays in wisdom and effective work of all citizens, calling ministries, courts, universities and other institutions to employ the minimum of 30% non-male employees. This brought satisfying effects to the economy, management and limited the corrupted networks. The great success of Victoria's enactment became known abroad. Already liberated France and other countries like Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled similar laws until the end of XIX century. Year 1902 was significant time of reflection over past transitions. New British Prime Minister, Constance Gilligan gave  her famous&nbsp;speech:<br><br>

				<div class="quote">
					"Through centuries we have claimed that governing a powerful country takes place with supposedly inevitable downpour of human blood. Innocent, unnecessary. In old, manly times, political systems were focused on power, separation, wealth and strength. Strength that was meant to destroy. Destruction that was meant to show greatness. Today we are entering the times not of a man. Today, we are entering the times of the human. Today we are aware of being interconnected, we are aware of the presence of the other, our impact on the other and of the fact that together with that other we are creating something much bigger than what we are alone. Today we will grow. Today we will see. Today we will think. We are a great country. And Today, we will know how to be what we are in a great&nbsp;way."
				</div><br><br>

				Which in political terms meant dismissing their reign over all worldwide colonies and renouncing their ownership of different type of economical, resource and cultural goods. It was a brave move for the Great British Empire, since they could keep their endless sources of benefits and still be one of the leading political giants of the world till this day. They could, with continuing explitation and inhumane practices, which has been finally admitted. In those times being accountable for one's impact on another entity in a political sense was rare. Under a cover of democracy, nations were leading their barbaric political games, not facing the reality of what the global outcome might&nbsp;be.<br><br>

				Gilligan's speech put the light on the connection between new ways of conscious governing of the empire and the psychological discoveries of the previous century. A good reference - probably the one that inspired the prime minister with the speech - would be to quote the American Psychiatrist and Sociologist, Carol Linklater, reflecting on the topic of taking one's voice. She&nbsp;writes:<br><br>

				<div class="quote">
					"Feminine refusal of taking one's voice is motivated by psychological protection - caring about other's feelings and awareness of relations. On the other hand it makes it easier for the patriarchal system to dismiss women's&nbsp;views. <br><br>

					[...]<br><br>

					Female approach to the conflict was often deeply admonishing. They were constantly trying not to disrupt the order of interrelations. What made their voice differ was the concern about the relations in the world that is rather focused on separation and building barriers between&nbsp;people."
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<img src="images/churchillina.jpg">
		
				Introducing non-heterosexuals and non-male individuals to the positions of governing structures brought relief to the dominant phenomenon of general aversion to any form of leadership/strategy that might denote a deliberate renunciation of the signs and privileges of the masculine&nbsp;role.<br><br>

				
					

				Not only because of the balancing of that phenomenon with the numbers of differently conditioned women, man and others. Also due to the fact that men who used to comply to the previous system, didn't have to bear the pressure of meeting the manly expectations. Within years it started being obvious that less oppressive/brutal/competing representations of power are possible, and moreover, can be as&nbsp;successful.<br><br>

      					<span>MY PERSONAL NOTES: <br><br>Yesterday, after writing the part about Constance Gilligan, I went to have some drinks with my newly made friends from Antonin Publishing <br>House. We had an interesting talk with Theodore and Changa about how sex transformed within those centuries. How was it even possible that <br>there were so many stigmas attached to sexual act, where did it all come from, that the value of a person was based on how much sexual<br>experience and of what kind they had. For us the idea of people being politically/institutionally assigned to one of the binary genders and having <br>to comply with all those norms against their nature is abstract. Theodore wondered who would we be now if the sexual revolution didn't take place. <br>We looked at each other. Theodore would definitely be male. I imagined hir without hirs sleek eyelashes and long dress, in a XX century styled suit, <br>all dark in colors, flat 'manly' leather shoes. The beard would have stayed. I imagined hir playing sport with similarly looking, young&nbsp;men.<br><br>I imagined hir marrying some feminine individual and having to fulfill the role of a strong, stable husband. We all laughed, although it was<br> all a little bit sad. Hir couldn't stand the idea of being limited to trousers and not wearing make up. It was less easy in case of Changa. <br>I didn't dare to ask about hirs genitals, we all knew each other just since Sunday. With hirs serious and sharp approach to work, attractive <br>and discrete intelligence, elegant style, hir was lacking any features that would put hir closer to 'male' or 'female'. Hir voice was low, <br>shoulders angular and thin. Hir was just a genuinely attractive person, without the use of specifically male or female tricks of charm. <br>Instead of giving us some opinion, hir suggested that we probably wouldn't have such infertility problems if our ancestors weren't so obsessed <br>with genital surgeries. Indeed, the world today is going through a serious problem, as one in three people are born infertile, while the <br>rest often refuses to have children because of their professional careers. We live in times when women from third world countries spend their <br>entire fertile years on serial surrogate motherhood, often being severely abused, providing us, privileged societies, with kids without <br>bearing the physical inconvenience of pregnancy. Our grandparents thought that we will be living in times when our genders won't limit us in <br>our pursuit of happiness and fulfilment. They didn't expect that in 2017 there would be hardly any CEO that wouldn't be an intersex person, <br>while in the ghettos of the same cities androgynous people would be massively kidnapped or raped by homophobes.

Coming from a traditional monogamous, Christian, <br>lesbian family. My biological mother was struggling for five years to get pregnant. My other mother was infertile, probably due to gender <br>surgeries of both of her parents. She comes from Hungary, where gender surgeries were very new in 1960s and many dangerous substances were <br>being used in hormonal medications. Apart from the hardship, our life was peaceful and steady. I couldn't imagine that my mothers and their <br>mutual love could have been ever seen as a perversion.

  				<h2>Consumerism in pink latex</h2>

				<h3>What is the visual identity of sex?<br><br>
				I see sex in Western culture of the XXI century as a product, phenomenon that at some point was assigned a visual identity. Just like visual identities of brands, companies, political structures, it has been designed based on some aspects of its idea, message, history with certain design decisions being made. My point here is that the designer was not a good designer.<br><br>

				Since my early years the picture of what meaning sex holds in one's life was a very particular topic. It was always a problematic one, although very exciting.<br><br>

				Imagine coming to the planet Earth, without having ever heard about or experienced sexual intercourse. Pink leather, black latex, winking strawberry showing a thumb up, flash light, red lips, black lines outlining eyes, fake fur, violet silicone, shouting typography, or decorative and kitsch one, laces, neons, shiny heels, metal elements, pikes, theatrical poses, necessity of pleasure, dull expressions, openness, vulnerability, leopard print.<br><br>

				I would like to find out WHY it is all so poorly designed, pictured, recorded. I have a hard time figuring out how it happened that sex in the mainstream visual culture got inseparable from the grotesque and kitsch representation. My sincere attempts to find any academic sources investigating the XXI century's visual culture of sex were completely unsatisfactory. In the browser, which is the most influential medium for pornographic contents, the websites are rarely developed professionally and operate on a one-hacker type of mentality. Moreover, they rarely feel a need to raise the aesthetic standards, since their success is independent of it - why investing money in that?<br><br>

				A young individuals discovers their sexual self at a certain point of growing up. The incoming excitement and needs of positioning themselves towards the new area requires seeking knowledge, sources of information that would introduce them to the new world that poses an incredible amount of questions. What I find extremely significant in the topic of formulation of the cultural identity of sex is that the very natural and inner sexual consciousness of the individual once awoken, seeks for explanations from the outside - culture, media, native models, customs. Yet with the fast sociological development caused by technology and todays economy, the behavioural trends are changing faster. No longer do models practised by our parents seem relevant. What are our models?<br><br>

				Just like a bold neon-red billboard with huge letters SALES and a given brand's logo attracts human attention, the red, blinking, shouting pornography affects the way we understand sex. To certain extent the power of shaping that form is in the hands of the user. In the digital era, where the sexual consumption is available, anonymous and (potentially) secure, he can chose from an extensive range of possibilities without guilt. The variety of options encourages the consumer, the consumer's interest encourages the market. I see it as a self-generating organism that feeds itself with our lust and feeds us with its productions. There are norms and there are deviations. By seeing all that is culturally constructed we transfer our arousal to the given content. We are having fantasies, but they are not our own. Our drives are vulnerable to how sex is being designed and sold. I would call it a consumerist degeneracy of hedonism of Western culture. I wanted to say that the standardised image of the topic of sex is a cultural failure of representation. On the other hand maybe it is rather a degeneracy of the sexual consumer? Or alternatively, is it a degeneracy? or is it a pure reflection of what we, humans in the end deeply want?<br><br>

				Peter Michelson writes in "The Aesthetics of Pornography":<br><br><br>

				<div class="quote">Whether we like it or not, [pornography] is an imagination driven record of human's sexual needs."</div><br><br>

				Again, in order to capture how those needs are being satisfied, we get back to the feminist topic - who do they primarily aim to satisfy? the art of pornography in Europe origins from the traditional paintings - nudes. As John Berger implies, in "Ways of Seeing", the main character of the painting is beyond the frame - the receiver (male) who stands in front of the painting is never captured in it, while it is for him that the nude emerges.<br><br>

				If we go to the years of the beginning of cinematography, we might tract how the standards for representation were set. The moment in which a photographic image came to existence was a crucial event in the development of representation. Although the technology was aiming to capture the same way the human eye could capture image in real life, the phenomenon of cinematographic fetish is based on the photographic camera's ability to register the image better than the human eye. The best example of that superiority is expressed by Leland Stanford's famous question whther a galloping horse ever lifts all four feet completely off the ground.<br><br>

				"Muybridge's eleven-volume opus, Animal Locomotion, published in 1887 (reprint 1979 in 3 vols.), offers the most striking illustration of this osmosis of knowledge and pleasure. These volumes are a giant pictorial study of men, women, children, and animals performing, in a series of photographs, short tasks designed to elicit a wide range of movements. Naked and semi-naked men, for exaple, walk, run, jump, throw, catch, box, wrestle, and perform simple trades such as carpentry. While naked and semi-naked women perform many of the same tasks, in their activities and gestures we see how the greater sexuality already encoded in the woman's body feeds into a new cinematic power exerted over her whole physical being. [...] While the men go about their business rather like Occident, Stanford's trotter, simply performing the functions they do best, the physical business of the women in less clearly defined, and their self-consciousness in its performance is much greater, they blow kisses, narcissistically twirl about, endlessly flirt fans, and wear transparent drapery that emphasises the nudity underneath."<br><br>

				Same or even more so happens in the contemporary representation of sex, not only in the form of pornography. The entire identity of sex is built on an assumption of the passive/active classification- passive, objectified female and active, consuming male. This has a long history and probably it could be said that it comes from the centuries-old tradition of diminishing women as secondary humans, the purpose of whom is to satisfy the primary ones. This being the core of the problematics that feminism has been fighting against since the very beginning - is no surprise. But what is interesting is how women position themselves towards it. Existing in the environment which defines them as the medium for representing sexuality, it is not that they are not being consumers.<br><br>

				<div class="quote"><br>The common problem in the development of female psychology is that because of the constant and conscious being in-relation with other people, the female exists in two versions of herself: the one she believes is expected from her to be by the people she's in relation with; the real her, experiencing and perceiving.</div> <br><br>

				The same happens in sex. The female is perfectly aware of the fact of being objectified, while at the same time being an aware consumer too. This duality of the female perception of the participation in a sexual act is a topic that should have been given much more attention, as the layering of it is indeed fascinating.<br><br>

				In the sexual context, the female adopts the role of an object, spectacle <- by looking at herself through the male eyes, stepping out of her own perspective <- while at the same time also being the consumer and experiencing the act. As a matter of fact she could be seen as an even bigger consumer, receiver of sex, since in the most default kind of intercourse, she is the one that sex is being done to. She does not have to provide much ( of energy, movement, ejaculate ), just give permission.<br><br>

				The same happens with sexual narratives. Even though cinematography, media, pornography etc. give women the role of objects in the sexual context, they are able to take over this perception and adapt it to their own experience. Nevertheless the way in which the above-mentioned perception is designed doesn't make it easy for women to relate to. It is made for men. As an effect women are less of the consumers of the sexual contents, show less interest in pornography - even though it works, it doesn't work in a satisfying way. This problem is being addressed more and more, since many female creatives working in porn field are taking up the challenge of creating new narratives for pornography that would focus on the satisfaction of female needs and would respond to the completely different way a female experiences sex.<br><br>

				Conclusion: We are facing a vicious circle in the portrayal of sex in our culture, where our needs of sex are being shaped by what the media have to offer, while what they offer us, is based on our need for sex.<br><br>

				At the same time, because of the strong tradition of seeing man as the default form of human, those representations offered by the media have been always neglecting to address the needs of female receivers, which (another vicious circle) has a certain influence on how women perceive the sexual self, and makes the structure of that experience much more layered.<br><br>

				The above reflections are obviously limited to just the heterosexual representations. I believe that homosexual, bisexual etc. phenomena might bring a whole new kind of sophisticated relations, the investigation of which is enough for a whole collection of books. <br><br>(I do not find myself as a relevant person to make conclusions on that topic though, but I'm aware of the importance of it)</h3><br><br>
  			<br><br><hr>



  			<h3><br><br>From the foregoing writing, it emerges how the identity of sex is deeply culturally and historically rooted or in other words manipulated. That is when it comes to produced content, staged representations, subliminal messages coming from media - all that is designed and given. In order to broad the investigation of the given identity of sex in Western world, more internal input was necessary, by which I mean not the representation, but comprehension of sex. What we are being fed with in media, literature, cinematography and internet might be in the end significantly different from what an individual, someone operating in the bare reality experiences and perceives.</h3><br><br>

<h2>I put myself into the role of an alien in order to explore what sex is to humans.</h2><br><br>

<h3>Willing to contextualise the identity of sexuality I needed to step out from my own knowledge and perspective. I thought the best way to capture the essence would be by dismissing my all existing ideas and prejudices and start with a tabula rasa, searching for answers from the surrounding world. For that purpose, I arranged several short interviews, questionnaires, asking people <br><br>
	<ul><li>What is sex?</li> 

<li>What color does sex have?</li> </ul><br>
In this chapter, since we are focusing on content, not form. What is sex? The success of the interviewing people from that point of view is hidden within the simplicity of the question itself. When predicting what kind of responses I might receive, I thought there will probably be several types of approaches:<br><br>

RYSUNEK s.34

INTERVIEWS<br><br>

My conclusions: Surprisingly little amount of people approached the topic in a simple way, describing some sort of mechanical, sexual activity, despite my insisting that I want to hear instant answers that do not have to be well-thought or sophisticated. What was common for all the cases was a general puzzlement after being faced with the question. It didn't happen due to the natural awkwardness of talking about sex - I warned my interviewees that I'm dealing with a sexual subject. The perplexed emotion seemed to come from an actual difficulty to explain what sex is. When reading the answers it confirms that the essence of sex is actually very hard to grasp and define. Many of the people I spoke with immediately turned to the direction of a metaphor or a description of the goals and fuctions of sex, instead of describing the sex itself. Were my assumptions wrong? I assumed that among the answers there would be some visible references to the pornographic narratives, while it seems like porn doesn't have that much of an influence on the understanding of sex within my study group.<br><br>

We are being bombarded with sexual imager, suggestive contents, we feel the presence of our inner sexual perception every day, finally we just do have sex, nevertheless to answer what it stands for causes us trouble. Probably there is just no ultimate answer to that question and I am pretty fine with that.<br><br>

Certainly, the answers that have been used so far - models for understanding and setting standards to sex and sexuality - didn't work out. Last decades, the times when people started being freer to speak have shown that. The rise of gay rights movements, feminism in all the waves and LGBTQ+ indicate that the current state of affairs does not meet the needs of humanity.</h3>
