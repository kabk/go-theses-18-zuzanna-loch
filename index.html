			<div class="front"><h2>I’m interested in the topic of cultural representation and understanding of sex.</h2></div>

			<h1>I’m interested in the culture-rooted perspectives and reasons for which they shaped the way we perceive sex. <br><br>
			Sexuality never stops being controversial. Some aspects are overly exposed in media and culture, while others keep being taboo'ed, connected with guilt, embarassment and shaming.I wonder where these emotions come from and whether they are culture or nature based. My hypothesis is that the way the sex is being approached is a cultural outcome of different political, religious, cultural influences from the history.
			Sex is part of our very intimate personal nature and psychology, yet we reach for ready made answers from culture to help us understand it and shape it to meet certain model, while the picture we get from culture is quite distorted. Or maybe it is completely right? I wonder what it does say about us as Western society.<br><br>I would like to explore how the phenomenon of sex is approached in different cultures and what effort is being made to manipulate the image of it. Further on I want to speculate on how it COULD be presented if we imagined dismissing the culturaly rooted tropes. I’m planning to read and watch academic materials about sexuality and gender psychology to understand the topic a bit and analyse the visual quality and representation in media and eventually come up with alternative scenarios.<h1>
