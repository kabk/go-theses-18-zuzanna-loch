			Hello people<br>This is my thesis abstract<br>Enjoy>

		<h1>
			What subject or subject field are you interested in Zuzanna?
		</h1>
		<p>
			I’m interested in the topic of cultural (visual?) identity of sexuality and the perception and understanding of the phenomenon of sex. I’m interested in the culture-rooted perspectives.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Why do you want to explore this subject?
		</h1>
		<p>
			I want to explore this subject because sexuality never stopps being controversial. Some aspects are being overly exposed in media and culture, while others keep being taboo connected with guilt, embarassment and shaming. The way the sex is being approached is an cultural outcome of different political, religious, cultural influences from the history.
		</p>
		<h1>
			What do you want to find out about this subject?
		</h1>
		<p>
			What I find interesting is that sexuality is part of our very intimate personal nature and psychology, yet we reach for ready made answers from culture to help us understand it and shape it to meet certain model, while the picture we get from culture is quite distorted. Or maybe it is completely right? I wonder what it does say about us as society.
			<br>I would like to explore how sexuality is being presented and defined in different cultures and what effort is being made to manipulate the image of it. Further on I want to speculate on how it COULD be presented if we imagined dismissing the culturaly rooted tropes. How sex would be portrayed if the heteronormative and male perception wasn’t dominant. How the female sexuality would be portrayed if it sex was less connected to procreation.
		</p>

		<h1>
			How might you go about finding this out/exploring this subject?
		</h1>
		<p>I’m planning to read and watch academic materials about sexuality and gender psychology to understand the topic a bit and analyse the visual quality and representation in media.<br>
		I want to research different approaches to the topic coming from various cultures. I would like to investigate on biggest influences in the history of the western culture that shaped the meaning and image of sexuality AND come up with a fictional alternative scenarios.<p>
